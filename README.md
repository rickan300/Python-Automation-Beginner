# Python-Automation-Beginner
some easy automation projects for beginners trying to improve

Working on some automation projects to improve skills and develop useful scripts
Goal is to complete 3 projects. Using a lot of online resources to help (shout out documentation, google, and youtube)

Project 1

photo editing to sharpen photos and add grayscale if you are into that kind of stuff
using a source directory for the original photos and a destination directory for the edited photos
the scripts goes through the source and makes edits then drops photo to the destination with desired edits

Project 2

Working with news API
I want the top 20 headlines to stay up to date on the news going on in the world
I want the output written to a file to make it a little cleaner
On the side I can set up a cron job to run it every day so I get that file and just read the headlines
Then I can decide to look more into those articles after or not

Project 3

Creating a grocery list that I can add items to and remove items
Making sure I can add multiple items at once and remove multiple at once
the program will take the input through the command line and create a txt file with the items so I can get my list and go to the grocery store
